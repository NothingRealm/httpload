# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of each individual and want all to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions is how we learn.

## What matters to us
- If you contribute to this project it must be because you want to not because you have to.
- You must accept that as a memeber of this opensource comunity you are responsible for the code you commit.  
- Every member of this comunity must be respectfull of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- Everyone must gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Be Considerate: Everyone is around to either help or be helped. Weâ€™re all around to learn. All the work we do affects someone else and we need to consider this when we make any changes.

## What we don't care about
We don't care about your level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.
